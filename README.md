<h2> ðŸ˜„Fun facts about me:</h2>
In my spare time, I find great joy in fishing, as well as listening to artist like Zach Bryan and Tyler Childers. Traveling is another passion of mine; I recently had the incredible opportunity to visit the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, a truly breathtaking experience. Adding to my adventures, I participated in my first half marathon at the Kentucky Derby, marking a memorable milestone in my journey.
